# Deploying CI/CD with ECS Container

#### Overview

Welcome to the next workshop in the **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** deployment series. In this section, we’ll set up CI/CD for the containers created in the previous part, utilizing AWS’s ECS service.

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** is an automation process frequently adopted by DevOps engineers to enhance workflow efficiency. Instead of manually performing deployment steps every time there is a change in the code—a repetitive process that consumes time and can become tedious—CI/CD automates the entire workflow. This allows all code changes to be swiftly reflected in the application. CI/CD is an invaluable tool that reduces the likelihood of errors and increases consistency throughout the development process.

Additionally, we’ll leverage AWS monitoring tools for continuous application tracking, allowing for timely detection and resolution of potential issues. These tools ensure that the application remains stable and performs optimally, delivering the best possible user experience.
